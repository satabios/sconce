Bored to read it thoroughly? Give a quick look at the mind map behind why this package was developed: `Mind Map <https://excalidraw.com/#json=Xt1nXZdQ5EWm-lOkGCqGm,yEsMLBW7yvHBAIfMVt8_Cg>`_. 
Then get grinding with a Quick Start Notebook:

If you are still reading, bruh!!!! Thank you...



The advancement of deep learning has been primarily driven by the availability of large datasets and the computational power to train large models. The complexity increases with each day, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to train/deploy these models.
However, the brain can learn from a few examples and is incredibly energy efficient (Psst.. that too sparsely).

Humans tend to solve problems from their lens of perspective, and thus, we comprehend the universe through mathematical models. One such postulation is the concept of gradient descent or other optimization techniques we use to train our models. However, the brain does not use gradient descent to learn. How the brain learns and can solve complex problems is still a mystery.

Until we hit the holy grail, we must make wise methods to achieve efficiency. **The logical solution is to minimize the usage of COPM (Performance, Computation, Power, Memory) and thus achieve high throughputs and latency gains.**

Hence, this package aims to bridge this gap by compressing a model end-to-end and making it hardware-friendly with Minimal Human Intervention.

* **AutoML at its Heart:** Humans are lazy, at least I am; hence, we want to get things done with Minimal Human Intervention. Sconce was built on this ideology that anyone with nominal knowledge of DL should be able to use this package. Drop your model into the package, call `sconce.compress`, and let it do the magic for you. 
* Compress the model through **Pruning**, **Quantization**, etc. 
* Bring your own dataset and let the **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** find the best model that fits your deployment constraints. 
* Leverage **Sparsity** in the model and deploy/infer using **Sparse Engines**. 
* Accelerate Inferencing and Reduce Memory Footprint,  Inference Optimizations:
        * CUDA Based:
                * Loop Unrolling
                * Loop Tiling
                * Loop Reordering

        * Inference Based:
                * Im2Col Convolution
                * In-Place Depth-Wise Convolution
                * Winograd
                * Memory Layout

* In addition, this package also supports **Spiking Neural Networks(snnTorch)** in this compression pipeline.

**sconce** is designed to be intuitively used with PyTorch, compression for Linear, Convolutional and Attention blocks are supported.

At present, I am working on adding support for more compression techniques and more models. kindly be patient for feature request/bug fixes. 

The package envisions to be a one stop solution for all your compression needs and deployed on resource constrained devices.
Provided that the network models and tensors are loaded onto CUDA, sconce takes advantage of GPU acceleration in the same way as PyTorch. 

sconce is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions from the community. The current status of the package and future plans can be found here: `sconce Roadmap <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A7s-wtMgphFwV_NqjqDFyhGn8CmxLFja/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104566359251512054257&rtpof=true&sd=true>`_.
